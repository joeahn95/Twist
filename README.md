Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).
